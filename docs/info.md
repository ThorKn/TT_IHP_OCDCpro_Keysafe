## How it works

There are four input pins and one output pin. The design simulates a setup with 16 different keys in form of binary numbers. Only one key (aka one number) can set the output pin to high.

## How to test

The correct input number is 1001. Only with this combination the output is set to high (1). All other inputs give a low (0) on the output.

## External hardware

Input switches. Output LED (light).
